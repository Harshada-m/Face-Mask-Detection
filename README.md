:star: Face Mask Detection System is a web application which helps to detect whether the person has worn a mask or not using **Deep Learning** and **Azure**.

-   Masks play a  **crucial**  role in protecting the  **health**  of individuals against  **respiratory diseases**, as is one of the  **few precautions**  available for  **COVID-19**  in the absence of  **immunization**.
    
-   The dataset is  **containing**  images of the  **different**  people  **with and without**  masks.


# **Conclusion**


-   Analyzed  **in-depth**  about the various  **features**  from the images.
    
-   Also build different models and  **compared**  their performance.
    
-   By using  **transfer learning**  **reduced the time**  of  **training**  the model and improved the accuracy of the model.
    
-   Created our final model using  **MobileNetV2**  and made predictions on the test set using it.
